- **NEW**: Server details include name, transport type, and enabled status ✅

### 🚀 Latest Features Added
**Enhanced MCP Server Management**:
- **Server Detail View**: Click the arrow next to any MCP group to expand and see individual servers
- **Status Indicators**: Color-coded dots show server connection status (green=connected, gray=disconnected, red=error)
- **Server Information**: Each server shows name, transport type (websocket/sse), and enabled/disabled status
- **Real-time Data**: Server information is fetched directly from the database with current status

### Debugging Steps
1. **Open Browser Console** (F12 → Console tab)
2. **Click on an agent** in the dropdown
3. **Check console logs** for:
   - "Agent change requested:" with agent data
   - "Agents to add:" showing the selected agent
   - API request success/failure messages
4. **Verify in UI**: Agent should appear in "Active Agents" section

### Test Scenarios Ready
- ✅ Agent Creation and Management
- ✅ MCP Group Assignment
- ✅ Thread-Scoped Agent Assignment
- ✅ Tool Discovery and Execution
- ✅ OAuth Credential Management

### Architecture Validation
- ✅ Scalable database schema with proper indexing
- ✅ Type-safe API layer with comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Reliable MCP connection management with retry logic
- ✅ Secure authentication and authorization system
- ✅ Performance-optimized query patterns

### 🔍 Updated Test Scenarios
**When MCP Servers Are Available**:
- Math operations will use real MCP math server instead of simulation
- GitHub operations will connect to actual GitHub MCP server
- Custom MCP servers can be added and will work immediately

**Current Behavior (No Live Servers)**:
- System detects no MCP servers are running
- Falls back gracefully to built-in tools only
- Logs attempts to connect (visible in console)
- No errors or system failures
- Ready to work immediately when servers become available
